GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 9 of 78 Version: 7.2

1.0 Introduction
This Certificate Policy (CP) applies to the products and services of GlobalSign NV/SA and affiliated entities (“GlobalSign”). Primarily, this pertains to the issuance and lifecycle management of Certificates including validity checking services. GlobalSign may also provide additional services such as timestamping. This CP may be updated from time to time as outlined in Section 1.5, Policy Administration. The latest version may be found on the GlobalSign group company repository https://www.globalsign.com/repository. (Alternative languages versions may be available to aid Relying Parties and Subscribers in their understanding of this CP, however, in the event of any inconsistency, the English version shall control).
A CP is a "named set of rules that indicates the applicability of a Digital Certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements.” This CP meets the formal requirements of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 3647, dated November 2003 with regard to content, layout and format (RFC 3647 obsoletes RFC 2527). An RFC issued by IETF is an authoritative source of guidance with regard to standard practices in the area of Electronic Signatures and Certificate management. While certain section titles are included in this policy according to the structure of RFC 3647, the topic may not necessarily apply to services of GlobalSign. These sections have ‘No stipulation’ appended. Where necessary, additional information is presented in subsections to the standard structure. Meeting the format requirements of RFC 3647 enhances and facilitates the mapping and interoperability with other third party CAs and provides Relying Parties with advance notice of GlobalSign’s practices and procedures.
This CP aims to comply with the requirements of:
• Browsers’ root programs
• RFC3647, Request for Comments: 3647, Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure:
Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework, Chokhani, et al, November 2003
• North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) Accreditation Requirements for
Authorized Certificate Authorities
• WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities
• WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities - SSL Baseline with Network
Security
• WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities - Extended Validation SSL
• WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities – Code Signing Baseline
Requirements
• WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities – S/MIME Certificates
• Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July
2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal
market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC
• The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions (Amendment
etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019)
• The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulation
2016 (2016 No.696))
This CP conforms to current versions of the CA/Browser Forum Requirements:
• CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates (“Baseline Requirements for TLS”)
• CA/Browser Forum Guidelines For The Issuance And Management Of Extended Validation Certificates (“EV Guidelines”)
• CA/Browser Forum Network and Certificate System Security Requirements
• CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements for Code Signing (“Baseline Requirements for
Code Signing”)
• CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements for S/MIME (“Baseline Requirements for
S/MIME”)1

GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 10 of 78 Version: 7.2
  
published at http://www.cabforum.org. If there is any inconsistency between this document and the CA/Browser Forum Requirements above, the CA/Browser Forum Requirements take precedence over this document.
This CP addresses areas of policy and practice such as, but not limited to, technical requirements, security procedures, personnel and training needs, which are required to meet industry best practices for Certificate lifecycle management. This CP applies to all Certificates issued by GlobalSign including its Root Certificates and any chaining services to third party Subordinate/Issuing CAs. Root Certificates are used to manage Certificate hierarchies through the creation of one or more Subordinate CAs that may or may not be controlled directly by the same entity that manages the Root Certificate itself.
This CP is applicable to the Subscriber and/or Relying Party, who uses, relies upon or attempts to rely upon certification services made available by the Certification Authority referring to this CP.
The English version of this CP is the primary version. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the English CP and any localized or translated version, the provisions of the English version shall prevail.
1.1 Overview
This CP applies to the complete GlobalSign hierarchy of GlobalSign and all Certificates that it issues either directly through its own systems, including self-signed Root Certificates and Key Pairs. The purpose of this CP is to present GlobalSign’s practices and procedures in managing Root Certificates and Issuing CAs in order to demonstrate compliance with formal industry accepted accreditations such as WebTrust. Additionally, eIDAS Regulation (Regulation (EU)N910/2014) (“eIDAS”) and eIDAS (UK Legislation) and The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations 2016 (“UK eIDAS”) provide for the recognition of Electronic Signatures that are used for the purposes of authentication or nonrepudiation. In this regard, GlobalSign operates within the scope of the applicable sections of the Law when delivering its services. Trust services for the United Kingdom are operated by and provided through GMO GlobalSign LTD., an affiliate entity of GlobalSign.
This CP sets out the objectives, roles, responsibilities and practices of all entities involved in the lifecycle of Certificates issued under this CP. In simple terms, a CP states “what is to be adhered to,” setting out an operational rule framework for products and services.
A Certification Practice Statement (CPS) complements this CP and states, “how the Certification Authority adheres to the Certificate Policy.” A CPS provides an end user with a summary of the processes, procedures and overall prevailing conditions that the Issuing CA (i.e. the entity which provides the Subscriber its Certificate) will use in creating and managing such Certificates.
In addition to this CP and the CPS, GlobalSign maintains additional documented policies which address such issues as:
• Business continuity and disaster recovery
• Security policy
• Personnel policies
• Key management policies
• Registration procedures
Additionally, other relevant documents include:
• The GlobalSign Warranty Policy that addresses issues on insurance;
• The GlobalSign Privacy Policy on the protection of personal data; and
• The GlobalSign Certification Practice Statement that addresses the methods and rules by
which Certificates are delivered for the domain of the GlobalSign top roots.

Certificates allow entities that participate in an electronic transaction to prove their identity to other participants or sign data digitally. By means of a Certificate, a Certification Authority provides confirmation of the relationship between a named entity (Subscriber) and its Public Key.
The process to obtain a Certificate includes the identification, naming, authentication and registration of an Applicant as well as aspects of Certificate management such as the issuance, revocation and expiration. By means of this policy, GlobalSign provides confirmation of the identity of the Subject of a Certificate by binding the Public Key the Subscriber uses through the issuance of a Certificate. An entity in this instance might include an end user or another Certification Authority. GlobalSign makes available Certificates that can be used for non-repudiation/contentCommitment, encryption and authentication. The use of these Certificates can be further limited to a specific business or contractual context or transaction level in support of a warranty policy or other limitations imposed by the applications that Certificates are used in.
GlobalSign accepts comments regarding this CP addressed to the address stated in Section 1.5, Policy Administration.

1.3 PKI Participants
1.3.1 Certification Authorities (“Issuer CAs”)
A Certification Authority (CA)’s primary responsibility is to perform tasks related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) functions such as Certificate lifecycle management, Subscriber registration, Certificate issuance, Certificate renewal, Certificate distribution and Certificate revocation. Certificate status information may be provided using a Repository in the form of a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution point and/or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder. A Certification Authority may also be described by the term “Issuing Authority” or “Issuer CA” to denote its purpose of issuing Certificates at the request of a Registration Authority (RA) from a Subordinate CA which may or may not be managed by GlobalSign.
The GlobalSign Policy Authority, which is composed of members of the GlobalSign management team and appointed by its Board of Directors, is responsible for maintaining this Certificate Policy relating to all Certificates in the GlobalSign hierarchy. Through its Policy Authority, GlobalSign has ultimate control over the lifecycle and management of the GlobalSign Root CA and any subsequent Subordinate CAs belonging to the hierarchy.
Henceforth and for ease of reference all CAs issuing Certificates in accordance with this CP (including GlobalSign) shall be referred to as Issuing CAs.
Issuing CAs ensure the availability of all services relating to the management of Certificates issued. Appropriate publication is necessary to ensure that Relying Parties obtain notice or knowledge of revoked Certificates. Issuing CAs provide Certificate status information using a Repository in the form of a CRL distribution point and/or OCSP responder as indicated within the Certificate properties.
1.3.2 Registration Authorities
Issuing CAs may act as a Registration Authority for Certificates they issue in which case they are responsible for:
• Accepting, evaluating, approving or rejecting the registration of Certificate applications;
• Registering Subscribers for certification services;
• Providing systems to facilitate the identification of Subscribers (according to the type of
Certificate requested);
• Using officially notarised or otherwise authorised documents or sources of information to
evaluate and authenticate an Applicant’s application;
• Requesting issuance of a Certificate via a multi-factor authentication process following the
approval of an application; and
• Initiating the process to revoke a Certificate from the applicable GlobalSign Subordinate
CA or partner Subordinate CA.
In addition to identifying and authenticating Applicants for Certificates, a Registration Authority (RA) may also initiate or pass along revocation requests for Certificates and requests for renewal and re-key of Certificates.
GlobalSign may delegate identity proofing and certificate lifecycle events to a third party, under conditions and if permitted by the applicable regulations, laws, industry standards and policies for the Certificate. Where applicable, delegation must be performed in accordance with the CA/Browser Forum Requirements.
Third parties who enter into a contractual relationship with GlobalSign may operate their own RA and authorize the issuance of Certificates. Third parties must comply with all the requirements of this CP and the terms of their contract which may also refer to additional criteria as recommended by the CA/B Forum. RAs may implement more restrictive vetting practices if their internal policy dictates.
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 22 of 78 Version: 7.2

Issuing CAs may designate an Enterprise RA to verify Certificate requests from the Enterprise RA’s own organization. In Enterprise RA, the Subscriber’s organization shall be validated and pre- defined, and shall be constrained by system configuration.
To issue certain Certificate types, RAs may need to rely on Certificates issued by third party Certification Authorities or other third-party databases and sources of information such as government national identity cards such as passports, eID, and drivers’ licenses. Where the RA relies on Certificates issued by a third party Certification Authority, RA must review the validation practices of the third party and relying party obligations by referring to such third party’s CPS.
1.3.3 Subscribers
Subscribers of Issuing CAs are either directly reliant on the Issuing CA to issue end entity Certificates from a hierarchy managed by the Issuing CA or they are third parties that seek to be issued with an Issuing CA capable of issuing additional Certificates to their own PKI hierarchy. Subscribers are either Legal Entities or natural persons that successfully apply for and receive a Certificate to support their use in transactions, communications and the application of Digital Signatures. In some cases, individuals are not able to obtain certain Certificate types.
A Subscriber, as used herein, refers to both the Subject of the Certificate and the entity that contracted with the Issuing CA for the Certificate’s issuance. Prior to verification of identity and issuance of a Certificate, a Subscriber is an Applicant.
End entity Subscribers have ultimate authority over the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key that is listed in a Subscriber’s Certificate. A Subscriber may or may not be the Subject of a Certificate (For example, machine or role-based Certificates issued to firewalls, routers, servers or other devices used within an organization).
1.3.4 Relying Parties
To verify the validity of a Certificate, Relying Parties must always refer to Issuing CA’s revocation information either in the form of a CRL distribution point or an OCSP responder.
1.3.5 Other Participants
Other participants include bridge CAs and CAs that cross certify Issuing CAs to provide trust among other PKI communities.
1.4 Certificate Usage
A Certificate allows an entity taking part in an electronic transaction to prove its identity to other participants in such transaction. Certificates are used in commercial environments as a digital equivalent of an identification card.
1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Usage
End entity Certificate use is restricted by the key usage and extended key usage values.
Unauthorised use of Certificates may result in the voiding of warranties offered by GlobalSign to Subscribers and their Relying Parties.
1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Usage
Certificate use is restricted by using Certificate extensions on key usage and extended key usage. Any usage of the Certificate inconsistent with these extensions is not authorised. Certificates are not authorised for use for any transactions above the designated reliance limits that have been indicated in the GlobalSign Warranty Policy.
Certificates do not guarantee that the Subject is trustworthy, operating a reputable business or that the equipment into which the Certificate has been installed is free from defect, malware or virus. In the case of code signing, Certificates do not guarantee that signed code is free from bugs or vulnerabilities.
Certificates issued under this CP may not be used:

2.0 Publication and Repository Responsibilities 2.1 Repositories
The Issuing CA shall publish all CA Certificates and Cross Certificates issued to and from the Issuing CA, revocation data for issued Certificates, CP, CPS, and Relying Party agreements and Subscriber Agreements in Repositories. The Issuing CA shall ensure that revocation data for issued Certificates and its Root Certificate are available through a Repository 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a minimum of 99% availability overall per year with a scheduled downtime that does not exceed 0.5% annually.
All parties who are associated with the issuance, use or management of Issuing CA Certificates are hereby notified that Issuing CAs may publish submitted information on publicly accessible directories for the provision of Certificate status information.
Issuing CAs may refrain from making publicly available certain sensitive and/or confidential documentation including security controls, operating procedures, and internal security policies. These documents are, however, made available to Qualified Auditors as required during any WebTrust or ETSI audit performed on GlobalSign.
Country specific web sites and translations of this CP and other public documentation may be made available by Issuing CAs for marketing purposes, however the repositories for all GlobalSign public facing documentation are https://www.globalsign.com/repository and https://www.globalsign.com/en/company/corporate-policies and in the event of any inconsistency, the English version shall control.
2.2 Publication of Certificate Information
GlobalSign publishes its CP, CPS, Subscriber Agreements, and Relying Party agreements at https://www.globalsign.com/repository. The CP and CPS must include all the material required by RFC 3647, and are structured in accordance with RFC 3647.
2.3 Time or Frequency of Publication
The CA shall develop, implement, enforce, and update at least every 365 days a Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement (CP and/or CPS) that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of the applicable CA/Browser Forum Requirements. The CA shall review and update its CP and/or CPS at least every 365 days, incrementing the version number and adding a dated changelog entry, even if no other changes are made to the document.
2.4 Access Controls on Repositories
The CA shall make its Repository publicly available in a read-only manner.
3.0 Identification and Authentication
Issuing CAs maintain documented practices and procedures to authenticate the identity and/or other attributes of the Applicant.
Issuing CAs use approved procedures and criteria to accept applications from entities seeking to become part of the CAs hierarchy, either as Subordinate CA seeking chaining services or as an RA, Enterprise RA or as an end entity Subscriber.
Issuing CAs must authenticate the requests of parties wishing to perform revocation of Certificates under this CP.
3.1 Naming
3.1.1 Types of Names
To identify a Subscriber, Issuing CAs shall follow naming and identification rules that include types of names assigned to the Subject, such as X.500 distinguished names RFC-822 names and X.400
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 34 of 78 Version: 7.2
   
names. DNs (Distinguished Names) must respect name space uniqueness and must not be misleading. RFC2460 (IP version 6) or RFC791 (IP version 4) addresses may be used.
For S/MIME BR Certificates, when the subject:commonName of a Certificate issued to an Individual does not contain a Mailbox Address, it is specified as a Personal Name or Pseudonym as described in Section 7.1.4.2.2(a). Names consisting of multiple words are permitted. Given names joined with a hyphen are considered as one single given name. Subjects with more than one given name may choose one or several of their given names in any sequence. Subjects may choose the order of their given name(s) and surname in accordance with national preference. The CA may allow common variations or abbreviations of Personal Names consistent with local practice.
3.1.2 Need for Names to be Meaningful
When applicable, Issuing CAs shall use distinguished names to identify both the Subject and issuer name of the Certificate.
For S/MIME BR Certificates, Personal Names shall be a meaningful representation of the Subject’s name as verified in the identifying documentation or Enterprise RA records.
3.1.3 Anonymity or Pseudonymity of Subscribers
Issuing CAs may issue end entity anonymous or pseudonymous Certificates provided that such Certificates are not prohibited by applicable policy and name space uniqueness is preserved.
For S/MIME BR Certificates, the use of the subject:pseudonym attribute shall be in accordance with section 3.1.3 of the Baseline Requirements for S/MIME.
Distinguished names in Certificates are interpreted using X.500 standards and ASN.1 syntax. See RFC 2253 and RFC 2616 for further information on how X.500 distinguished names in Certificates are interpreted as Uniform Resource Identifiers and HTTP references.
3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms
For S/MIME BR Certificates, interpreting various name forms shall be performed in accordance with section 3.1.4 of the Baseline Requirements for S/MIME.
3.1.5 Uniqueness of Names
No stipulation.
3.1.6 Recognition, Authentication, and Role of Trademarks
Subscribers may not request Certificates with any content that infringes the intellectual property rights of another entity. This CP does not require that an Applicant’s right to use a trademark be verified. However, Issuing CAs may reject any applications or require revocation of any Certificate that is part of a dispute.
3.2 Initial Identity Validation
Issuing CAs may perform identification of the Applicant or for services including CA chaining services using any legal means of communication or investigation necessary to identify the Legal Entity or Individual.
Issuing CAs may use the result of a successful Subject DN initial identity validation process to create alternative product offerings by effectively combining elements of previously verified information with alternative, newly verified, information. A suitable account based challenge response mechanism must be used to authenticate any previously verified information for any returning Applicant provided that the re-verification requirements of Section 3.3.1 are complied with.
3.2.1 Method to Prove Possession of Private Key
No stipulation
3.2.2 Authentication of Organization Identity
For all Certificates that include an organization identity, Applicants are required to indicate the organization’s name and registered or trading address. The legal existence, legal name, legal form (where included in the request or part of the legal name in the jurisdiction of incorporation) and
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 35 of 78 Version: 7.2

provided address of the organization must be verified and any methods used must be highlighted in the CPS.
The authority of the Applicant to request a Certificate on behalf of the organization must be verified in accordance with Section 3.2.5.
3.2.2.1 Local Registration Authority Authentication
For accounts that allow the concept of a Local Registration Authority, Issuing CAs and RAs may set authenticated organizational details in the form of a Profile. Suitably authenticated account administrators acting in the capacity of a Local Registration Authority must authenticate Individuals affiliated with the organization and/or any sub-domains owned or controlled by the organization. (Whilst LRA’s are able to authenticate Individuals under contract, all Domain Names to be authenticated must have previously had the appropriate higher-level Domain Name pre-authorized and authenticated in compliance with this CP and the applicable CA/Browser Forum Requirements).
3.2.2.2 Machine, Device, Department, and Role based Certificate Authentication (DepartmentSign)
Issuing CAs must ensure that requests for machine, device, department, or role-based Certificates are authenticated either by a RA, acting on behalf of the CA, or an LRA that is contractually obligated to the Issuing CA/RA to ensure that machine, device, department, or role-based names relating to the organization and its business are accurate and correct.
3.2.2.3 S/MIME BR Certificates
For S/MIME BR Certificates, the Organization identity shall be authenticated according to section 3.2.3 of the Baseline Requirements for S/MIME.
3.2.2.4 Qualified Certificates
GlobalSign issues three types of Qualified Certificates that include an Organization Identity:

jurisdiction of the Organization’s legal creation, existence or recognition; or
• records provided by a Qualified Independent Information Source.
Additionally, GlobalSign may verify the address by reference to:
• a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant letter; or
• an attestation of the physical location signed using the Organization’s valid Qualified
Electronic Seal.
The information in the attestation must match the content of the Qualified Certificate.
The Full Legal Name of the Organization, doing business as names (Trade Name or Trading As Name) may also be included in the Qualified Certificate. GlobalSign will verify that the Organization has registered the use of any included doing business as name with the appropriate government agency for such filings in the jurisdiction of its Place of Business, and that such filing continues to be valid.
For Certificates that assert the Individual’s affiliation with an Organization, GlobalSign will verify this affiliation by reference to:
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 36 of 78 Version: 7.2

• Confirmation provided by the Organization, obtained using a Verified Method of Communication; or
• Independent Confirmation from the Organization; or
• a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant letter; or
• an attestation signed using the Organization’s valid Qualified Electronic Seal; or
• an attestation obtained by a suitably authenticated account administrators acting in the
capacity of a Local Registration Authority.
For Qualified Certificates that assert the identity of the Organization and for Qualified Website Authentication Certificates, GlobalSign will verify the identity and the authority of the Organization’s authorised representative(s).
GlobalSign will verify the authority of the authorised representative(s) by reference to:
• official government records provided in Qualified Government Information Sources; or
• documentation provided by or confirmation received from a government agency in the
jurisdiction of the Organization’s legal creation, existence or recognition; or
• records provided by a Qualified Independent Information Source; or
• a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant letter; or
• an attestation the signed using the Organization’s valid Qualified Electronic Seal. The
information in the attestation must match the content of the Qualified Certificate.
GlobalSign will verify the identity of the authorised representative in accordance with section 3.2.3.
For any Open Banking Specific Attributes, GlobalSign will validate attributes using information provided by the National Competent Authority, which includes but is not limited to national public registers, European Banking Authority registers and authenticated communication from the National Competent Authority.
If GlobalSign is notified of an email address where it can inform the NCA identified in a newly issued certificate then GlobalSign shall send to that email address information on the content of the certificate in plain text including the certificate serial number in hexadecimal, the subject distinguished name, the issuer distinguished name, the certificate validity period, as well as contact information and instructions for revocation requests and a copy of the a certificate file.

4. Performing a postal challenge to the Applicant using an address obtained from a reliable source; or
5. The Applicant’s seal impression (in jurisdictions that permit their use to legally sign a document) is included with any application received in writing.
For AATL, the options are defined as follows. Please note that these options are also available for other Class 2 products:
1. Receiving an attestation from an appropriate notary or Trusted Third Party that they have verified the individual identity based on a Governmentally Accepted Form of ID.
2. In the case of individuals affiliated with an organization: obtaining an executed declaration of identity of the individual that includes at least one unique biometric identifier of the individual (such as a fingerprint or handwritten signature). In this executed declaration of identity, an authorized representative of the Organization mentioned in the certificate confirms having seen the individual, reviewed the individual’s photo ID, and confirm that the individual’s identity information in the certificate requests matches the information contained in the reviewed photo ID. GlobalSign confirms the document’s authenticity directly with the authorized representative of the organization using contact information confirmed using a Qualified Independent Information Source or a Qualified Government Information Source or any other method in line with the EV Guidelines. GlobalSign confirms the authorized representative’s authority to represent the Organization in line with the EV Guidelines.
3. In the case of individuals affiliated with an organization, GlobalSign may rely on attestations from the approved Local RA. Refer to 3.2.3.5 in case of a Class 2 Certificate requested through an EPKI or an MSSL profile.
4. Receiving an attestation from an organization to validate the identities of its own end customers based on a verification of a Governmentally Accepted Form of ID, while the organization maintains a secure auditable trail of these verifications.
5. Other verifications in line with the verification of individuals for Qualified Certificates.
GlobalSign may request further information from the Applicant. Other information and/or methods may be utilized in order to demonstrate an equivalent level of confidence.
If an email address is to be included in the Certificate request, GlobalSign or LRA shall verify the validity and ownership of that email address.

For EV Code Signing Certificates issued prior to April 24, 2023, the Subscriber’s private key must be generated, stored and used in a crypto module that meets or exceeds the requirements of FIPS 140-2 level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+.
Effective April 24, 2023, Subscriber Private Keys for EV and Non-EV Code Signing Certificates must be generated and protected in a Hardware Crypto Module with a unit design form factor certified as conforming to at least FIPS 140‐2 Level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+.
Where it is possible to make a backup of a Private Key, Subscribers must use the same level of care and protection attributed to the live Private Key. At the end of the useful life of a Private Key, Subscribers must securely delete the Private Key and any fragments that it has been split into for the purposes of backup.
In the case of GlobalSign’s digital signing service, and with the consent of the Subscriber, GlobalSign shall host, secure, and manage short-lived Certificates and corresponding Private Keys in a conformant HSM/QSCD.
See Section 9.6.3, provisions 2. and 4.
4.5.2 Relying Party Public Key and Certificate Usage
Issuing CAs must describe the conditions under which Certificates may be relied upon by Relying Parties within their CPS including the appropriate mechanisms available to verify Certificate validity (e.g. CRL or OCSP). Issuing CAs must also offer a Relying Party agreement to Subscribers the content of which should be presented to the Relying Party. Relying Party must accept and act in accordance with the Relying Party Agreement prior to reliance upon a Certificate from the Issuing CA. Relying Parties should use the information to make a risk assessment and as such are solely responsible for performing the risk assessment prior to relying on the Certificate or any assurances made.
Software used by Relying Parties should be fully compliant with X.509 standards including best practice for chaining decisions around policies and key usage.

CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository;
9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA’s CP and/or CPS;
10. The technical content or format of the Certificate presents an unacceptable risk to
Application Software Suppliers or Relying Parties (e.g. the CA/B Forum might determine that a deprecated cryptographic/signature algorithm or key size presents an unacceptable risk and that such Certificates should be revoked and replaced by CAs within a given period of time).
Issuing CAs that cross sign other Issuing CAs may revoke the Issuing CA if the cross signed Issuing CA no longer meets the contractual terms and conditions of the agreement between the two parties.
4.9.2 Who Can Request Revocation
The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the Issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke a Certificate.
Issuing CAs may also at their own discretion revoke Certificates including Certificates that are issued to other cross signed Issuing CAs.
Additionally, for Open Banking Certificates, revocation request can originate from the NCA which has authorized or registered the payment service provider.
4.9.3 Procedure for Revocation Request
The CA shall provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process shall be described in the CA's CP and/or CPS. The CA shall maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.
The CA shall provide clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA shall publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.
4.9.4 Revocation Request Grace Period
For SSL and Code Signing Certificates, GlobalSign does not support a revocation request grace period.
For all other Certificates, the revocation request grace period is the time available for a Subscriber to take any necessary actions themselves in order to request revocation of a suspected Key Compromise, use of a weak key or discovery of inaccurate information within an issued Certificate. Issuing CAs should allow Subscribers a maximum of 48 hours to take appropriate action to revoke or take appropriate action on behalf of Subscribers.
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 49 of 78 Version: 7.2

4.9.5 Time Within Which CA Must Process the Revocation Request
Issuing CAs shall begin investigating Certificate Problem Reports within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of the report.
All revocation requests for end entity Certificates, both those generated automatically via user accounts and those initiated by the Issuing CA itself, must be processed within a maximum of 30 minutes of receipt.
Issuing CAs that cross sign other CAs should process a revocation request within 24 hours of a confirmation of Compromise and an ARL should be published within 12 hours of any off-line ARL key ceremony.
Issuing CAs and RAs shall maintain 24 x 7 ability to respond internally to a high-priority Certificate Problem Report through report abuse channel and, where appropriate, forward such a complaint to law enforcement authorities, and/or revoke a Certificate that is the subject of such a complaint. Issuing CAs and RAs shall begin investigation procedures for a suspected Key Compromise or misuse of a Certificate within 24 hours of receipt of the report.
Issuing CAs and RAs shall decide whether revocation or other action is warranted based on at least following criteria:
• The nature of the alleged problem;
• The number of reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
• The entity making the complaint; and
• Relevant legislation.
For Qualified Certificates, actual revocation status shall be published/available through all revocation mechanisms within 60 minutes after the revocation decision and will never be reverted.
4.9.6 Revocation Checking Requirements for Relying Parties
Prior to relying on a Certificate, Relying Parties must validate the suitability of the Certificate for the intended purpose and ensure the Certificate is valid. Relying Parties will need to consult CRL or OCSP information for each Certificate in the chain as well as validating that the Certificate chain itself is complete. This may include the validation of Authority Key Identifier (AKI) and Subject Key Identifier (SKI). Issuing CAs may include all applicable URLs within the Certificate to aid Relying Parties in performing the revocation checking process.
For Qualified Certificates, validation of the certificate chain shall be carried out successfully up to the Issuing CA trust anchor within the EU or UK eIDAS trusted list.
4.9.7 CRL Issuance Frequency
All Issuing CAs must meet the requirements of the applicable CA/Browser Forum Requirements and eIDAS regulations.
If CRLs are provided and the CA decides or is required to terminate a CRL, the CA shall issue and publish at the corresponding CRL Distribution Point a last CRL with a nextUpdate field value “99991231235959Z”. The CA shall not issue a last CRL until all Certificates in the scope of the CRL are either expired or revoked and shall preserve the integrity and the availability of the last CRL at least for the period specified in the CPS.
For the status of Subscriber Certificates:
If the CA publishes a CRL, then the CA shall update and re-issue CRLs at least once every seven days, and the value of the nextUpdate field must not be more than ten days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.
For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:
If the Subordinate CA contains a CDP, the CA shall update and re-issue CRLs at least (i) once every twelve months and (ii) within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate, and the
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 50 of 78 Version: 7.2

value of the nextUpdate field must not be more than twelve months beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.
4.9.8 Maximum Latency for CRLs
CRLs are posted to the repository within a commercially reasonable time after generation.
4.9.9 On-Line Revocation/Status Checking Availability
Issuing CAs that support OCSP responses in addition to CRLs shall provide response times no longer than 10 seconds under normal network operating conditions.
Issuing CAs’ OCSP responses shall conforms to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses shall be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is being checked. OCSP signing Certificate must contain an extension of type id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck, as defined by RFC6960.
4.9.10 On-Line Revocation Checking Requirements
OCSP responders operated by the CA shall support the HTTP GET method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019.
The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.
For the status of Subscriber Certificates:
1. OCSP responses must have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours.
2. OCSP responses must have a validity interval less than or equal to ten days.
3. For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, then the CA shall
update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol prior to one-half
of the validity period before the nextUpdate.
4. For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, then the
CA shall update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.
For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:
• The CA shall update information provided via an OCSP Responder (i) at least every twelve
months and (ii) within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.
If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a Certificate serial number that is "unused", then the responder should not respond with a "good" status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with Section 7.1.5, the responder shall not respond with a "good" status for such requests.
The CA should monitor the OCSP responder for requests for "unused" serial numbers as part of its security response procedures.
A certificate serial number within an OCSP request is one of the following three options:
1. “assigned” if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject; or
2. “reserved” if a Precertificate [RFC6962] with that serial number has been issued by
a. the Issuing CA; or
b. a Precertificate Signing Certificate associated with the Issuing CA; or
3. “unused” if neither of the previous conditions are met.
4.9.11 Other Forms of Revocation Advertisements Available
If the Subscriber Certificate is for a high-traffic FQDN, Issuing CA may choose to rely on stapling, in accordance with RFC4366, to distribute its OCSP responses. In this case, Issuing CA shall ensure that the Subscriber “staples” the OCSP response for the Certificate in its TLS handshake.
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 51 of 78 Version: 7.2

Issuing CA shall enforce this requirement on the Subscriber contractually through the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, or by technical review measures implemented by the CA.
4.9.12 Special Requirements Related to Key Compromise
Issuing CAs and related Registration Authorities shall use commercially reasonable methods to inform Subscribers that their Private Key may have been Compromised. This includes cases where new vulnerabilities have been discovered or where the Issuing CA at their own discretion decides that evidence suggests a possible Key Compromise has taken place. Where Key Compromise is not disputed Issuing CAs shall revoke Issuing CA Certificates or Subscriber end entity Certificates and publish a revised CRL within 24 hours.
4.9.13 Circumstances for Suspension
Certificate suspension is only allowed for Client Certificates. Certificate suspension is not allowed for any other types of end entity Certificates. Certificate suspension is strictly forbidden for SSL Certificates and Qualified Certificates.
4.9.14 Who Can Request Suspension
Issuing CAs and RAs shall accept authenticated requests for suspension. Authorization for suspension shall be accepted if the suspension request is received from either the Subscriber or an affiliated organization named in the Certificate. Issuing CAs may also at their own discretion suspend Certificates including Certificates that are issued to other cross signed Issuing CAs.
4.9.15 Procedure for Suspension Request
Due to the nature of suspension requests and the need for efficiency, Issuing CAs and RAs may provide automated mechanisms for requesting and authenticating suspension requests; for example, through an account which issued the Certificate that is requested to be suspended. RAs may also provide manual backup processes in the event that automated suspension methods are not possible. Issuing CAs and RAs will record each request for suspension and authenticate the source, taking appropriate action to suspend the Certificate if the request is authentic and approved. Once suspended, the serial number of the Certificate and the date and time shall be added to the appropriate CRL. CRL reason code “certificateHold” will be included. CRLs may be published immediately or they may be published as defined within the Issuing CA’s CPS.
4.9.16 Limits on Suspension Period
There are no limits on the Certificate suspension period.
4.10 Certificate Status Services
4.10.1 Operational Characteristics
Issuing CAs shall provide a Certificate status service either in the form of a CRL distribution point or an OCSP responder or both. Revocation entries may be removed after expiry of the Certificate to promote more efficient CRL file size management, except for Code Signing Certificates (only 10 years after expiry).
For other Certificate types, Issuing CAs shall not remove revocation entries on CRL or OCSP until after the Expiry Date of the revoked Certificate.
If required by Root Programs or CA/B Forum requirements, Issuing CAs may backdate revocation of Certificates with the revocationDate field, as an exception to the best practice described in RFC 5280 to use the invalidityDate field.
4.10.2 Service Availability
Issuing CAs shall maintain 24x7 availability of Certificate status services and may choose to use additional content distribution network cloud based mechanisms to aid service availability. Issuing CAs shall maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to respond internally to a high-priority Certificate Problem Report, and where appropriate, forward such a complaint to law enforcement authorities, and/or revoke a Certificate that is the subject of such a complaint.
4.10.3 Operational Features
No stipulation
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 52 of 78 Version: 7.2

4.11 EndofSubscription
Subscribers may end their subscription to Certificate services by having their Certificate revoked or naturally letting it expire. Where Issuing CAs have issued Issuing CAs capable of end entity issuance contracts between parties must be maintained unless revocation is used to terminate the contract.
4.12 Key Escrow and Recovery
4.12.1 Key Escrow and Recovery Policy and Practices
CA Private Keys are never escrowed. An Issuing CA that offers key escrow services to Subscribers may escrow Subscriber Private Keys. Any Private Keys that are escrowed must be held in at least the same level of security as when the Key Pair was originally created.
4.12.1.1 S/MIME BR
The CA may escrow the Subscriber’s Private Key as specified in the CA's CP and/or CPS.
The CA shall notify Subscribers when their Private Keys are escrowed. Escrowed Private Keys shall be stored in encrypted form. The CA shall protect escrowed Private Keys from unauthorized disclosure.

trusted code, and malware detection/prevention;
3. network security and firewall management, including port restrictions and IP address
filtering;
4. user management, separate trusted-role assignments, education, awareness, and
training; and
5. logical access controls, activity logging, and inactivity time-outs to provide individual
accountability.
The CA's security program shall include an annual Risk Assessment that:
1. Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 53 of 78 Version: 7.2

2. Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and
3. Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.
Based on the Risk Assessment, the CA shall develop, implement, and maintain a security plan consisting of security procedures, measures, and products designed to achieve the objectives set forth above and to manage and control the risks identified during the Risk Assessment, commensurate with the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan shall include administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan shall also take into account then-available technology and the cost of implementing the specific measures, and shall implement a reasonable level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from a breach of security and the nature of the data to be protected.
5.1 Physical Controls
Issuing CAs shall have physical and environmental security policies for systems used for Certificate issuance and management which cover physical access control, natural disaster protection, fire safety factors, failure of supporting utilities (e.g. power, telecommunications), structure collapse, plumbing leaks, protection against theft, breaking & entering, and disaster recovery. Controls shall be implemented to avoid loss, damage or Compromise of assets and interruption to business activities and theft of information and information processing facilities.
5.1.1 Site Location and Construction
Issuing CAs shall ensure that critical and sensitive information processing facilities are housed in secure areas with appropriate security barriers and entry controls. They shall be physically protected from unauthorized access, damage and interference, and the protections provided shall be commensurate with the identified risks in risk analysis plans.
5.1.2 Physical Access
Issuing CAs shall ensure that the facilities used for Certificate life cycle management are operated in an environment that physically protects the services from Compromise through unauthorized access to systems or data. An authorized employee shall always accompany any unauthorized person entering a physically secured area. Physical protections shall be achieved through the creation of clearly defined security perimeters (i.e. physical barriers) around the systems hosting the CA operations. No parts of the CA premises shall be shared with other organizations within this perimeter.
5.1.3 Power and Air Conditioning
Issuing CAs shall ensure that the power and air conditioning facilities are sufficient to support the operation of the CA system.

GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 54 of 78 Version: 7.2

5.1.8 Off-Site Backup
Issuing CAs shall ensure that full system backups of the Certificate issuance system are sufficient to recover from system failures and are made periodically, as defined in the Issuing CA’s CPS. Back-up copies of essential business information and software must be taken regularly. Adequate back-up facilities must be provided to ensure that all essential business information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure. Back-up arrangements for individual systems shall be regularly tested to ensure that they meet the requirements of business continuity plans. At least one full backup copy must be stored at an offsite location (at a location separate from the Certificate issuance equipment). Backups shall be stored at a site with physical and procedural controls commensurate to that of the operational facility.
5.2 Procedural Controls
5.2.1 Trusted Roles
Issuing CAs should ensure that all operators and administrators including Validation Specialists are acting in the capacity of a trusted role. Trusted roles are such that no conflict of interest is possible, and the roles are distributed such that no single person can circumvent the security of the CA system.
GlobalSign may subscribe Certificates for GlobalSign affiliate companies, or persons identified in association with these companies (as a subject). GlobalSign affiliate companies includes GlobalSign's parent and subsidiary companies, as well and other companies that share a same parent company as GlobalSign.
Trusted roles include but are not limited to the following:
• Developers: Responsible for development of CA systems.
• Security Manager: overall responsibility for administering the implementation of the CA's
security practices, cryptographic key life cycle management functions (e.g., key
component custodians);
• Administrator: approval of the generation, revocation and suspension of Certificates;
• System Engineer: installation, configuration and maintenance of the CA
systems, viewing and maintenance of CA system archives and audit logs;
• Operator: day-to-day operation of CA systems and system backup and recovery;
• Key Manager: cryptographic key life cycle management functions (e.g., key component
custodians).
5.2.2 Number of Persons Required per Task
Issuing CAs shall state the number of persons required per task within their CPS. The goal is to guarantee the trust for all CA services (Key Pair generation, Certificate generation, and revocation) so that any malicious activity would require collusion. Where multiparty control is required, at least one of the participants shall be an Administrator. All participants shall serve in a trusted role as defined in Section 5.2.1 above.
5.2.3 Identification and Authentication for Each Role

5.7 Compromise and Disaster Recovery
5.7.1 Incident and Compromise Handling Procedures
Issuing CAs shall establish business continuity procedures that outline the steps to be taken in the event of the corruption or loss of computing resources, software and/or data that could disturb or Compromise the Issuing CA services. Issuing CAs should carry out risk assessments to evaluate business risk and determine the necessary security requirements and operational procedures to be taken as a consequence of its disaster recovery plan. This risk analysis is regularly reviewed and revised if necessary (threat evolution, vulnerability evolution, etc.). This business continuity is included in the scope of the audit process as described in Section 8 to validate which operations should be first restored after a disaster and the recovery plan.
Issuing CA personnel that serve in a trusted role and operational role should be specially trained to operate according to procedures defined in the disaster recovery plan for business critical operations.
If an Issuing CA detects a potential hacking attempt or another form of Compromise, it should perform an investigation in order to determine the nature and the degree of damage. Otherwise, the Issuing CA should assess the scope of potential damage in order to determine if the CA or RA system needs to be rebuilt, if only some Certificates need to be revoked, and/or if a CA hierarchy needs to be declared as Compromised. The CA disaster recovery plan should highlight which services should be maintained (for example, revocation and Certificate status information).
5.7.2 Computing Resources, Software, and/or Data Are Corrupted
If any equipment is damaged or rendered inoperative, but the Private Keys are not destroyed, the operation should be re-established as quickly as possible, giving priority to the ability to generate Certificate status information according to the Issuing CA’s disaster recovery plan.
5.7.3 Issuing CA Private Key Compromise Procedures
In the event an Issuing CA Private Key is Compromised, lost, destroyed, or suspected to be Compromised:
• The Issuing CA shall, after investigation of the problem, decide whether the Issuing CA Certificate should be revoked. If so, then:
o All the Subscribers who have been issued a Certificate will be notified at the earliest feasible opportunity; and
o A new Issuing CA Key Pair shall be generated, or an alternative existing CA hierarchy shall be used to create new Subscriber Certificates.
5.7.4 Business Continuity Capabilities After a Disaster
The disaster recovery plan deals with the business continuity as described in Section 5.7.1. Certificate status information systems should be deployed so as to provide 24 hours per day, 365 days per year availability.
5.8 CA or RA Termination
When it is necessary to terminate an Issuing CA or RA activities, the impact of the termination must be minimized as much as possible in light of the prevailing circumstances and is subject to the applicable Issuing CA and/or Registration Authority Agreements. Issuing CAs must specify the procedures they will follow when terminating all or a portion of their Digital Certificate issuance and management operations. The procedures must, at a minimum:
• ensure that any disruption caused by the termination of an Issuing CA is minimised as much as possible;
• ensure that archived records of the Issuing CA are retained;
• ensure that prompt notification of termination is provided to Subscribers, Authorised
Relying Parties, Application Software Providers, and other relevant stakeholders in
GlobalSign certificate lifecycles;
• ensure Certificate status information services are provided and maintained for the
applicable period after termination, including, if applicable, transferring Certificate status information services to another GMO Internet Group entity;
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 60 of 78 Version: 7.2

• ensure that a process for revoking all Digital Certificates issued by an Issuing CA at the time of termination is maintained;
• notify all auditors including the eIDAS/UK eIDAS Conformity Assessment Bodies; and
• notify the Belgian eIDAS supervisory body (FPS Economy, SMEs, Self-employed and
Energy - Quality and Safety)

script during its Key and Certificate generation process and the controls used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the Key Pair.
In other CA Key Pairs, issuing CA shall performs following controls;
1. Generates the keys in a physically secured environment as described in Section 5.1 and
5.2.2. of Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
2. Generates the CA keys using personnel in trusted roles under the principles of multiple
person control and split knowledge;
3. Generate the CA keys within cryptographic modules meeting the applicable technical and
business requirements as disclosed in the CA’s Certificate Policy and/or Certification
Practice Statement;
4. Log its CA key generation activities; and
5. maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Private Key was
generated and protected in conformance with the procedures described in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement and (if applicable) its Key Generation Script.
Issuing CAs shall generate all issuing Key Pairs in a physically secure environment by personnel in trusted roles under, at least, dual control. External witnesses (Ideally an independent auditor who normally performs audits on a regular basis) should be present or the ceremony, as a whole, must be videotaped/recorded. Issuing CA key generation is carried out within a device which is at least certified to FIPS 140-2 level 3.
Issuing CA shall also reject a certificate request if it has a known weak Private Key.
6.1.1.2 Subscriber Key Pair Generation
For Subscriber keys generated by issuing CA, Key generation must be performed in a secure cryptographic device that meets FIPS 140-2 (or equivalent) using key generation algorithm and key size as specified in Section 6.1.5 and 6.1.6. Where applicable, Subscriber keys must be generated in accordance with the CA/Browser Forum Requirements and eIDAS regulations.
Keys used for Code Signing Certificates must be generated on a Hardware Crypto Module with a unit design form factor certified as conforming to at least FIPS 140‐2 Level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+.
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 61 of 78 Version: 7.2

For Qualified Certificates where the Private Key related to the certified Public Key resides in a QSCD, Subscriber keys must be generated and stored within a recognized Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD). Issuing CAs shall monitor QSCD certification status and apply appropriate measures, including revocation, if the certification status of a QSCD changes.
6.1.2 Private Key Delivery to Subscriber
Issuing CAs that create Private Keys on behalf of Subscribers may do so only when sufficient security is maintained within the key generation process and any onward issuance process to the Subscriber. The cryptographic algorithms regarding Public/Private key generation (encryption, sign, cryptographic hash, RNG or PRNG etc.) were approved by FIPS, the Public/Private key generation algorithm is also specified in FIPS 186-4.
Where applicable, the CA shall perform private key delivery to Subscriber in accordance with section 6.1.2 of the applicable CA/Browser Forum Requirements.
6.1.3 Public Key Delivery to Certificate Issuer
Issuing CAs shall only accept Public Keys from RAs that have been protected during transit and have had the authenticity and integrity of their origin from the RA suitably verified.
6.1.4 CA Public Key Delivery to Relying Parties
Issuing CAs shall ensure that Public Key delivery to Relying Parties is undertaken in such a way as to prevent substitution attacks. This may include working with commercial browsers and platform operators to embed Root Certificate Public Keys into root stores and operating systems. Issuing CA Public Keys may be delivered by the Subscriber in the form of a chain of Certificates or via a Repository operated by the Issuing CA and referenced within the profile of the issued Certificate.
6.1.5 Key Sizes
GlobalSign follows NIST Special Publication 800-133 Revision 2 (2020) - Recommendation for Cryptographic Key Generation - for recommended timelines and best practices in the choice of Key Pairs for Root CAs, Issuing CAs and end entity Certificates delivered to Subscribers.

   The Key Pair usage period can be up to the Certificate Validity Period.
Certificates signed by a specific CA must expire before or at the end of that CA Certificate Validity period.
For the purpose of calculations, a day is measured as 86,400 seconds. Any amount of time greater than this, including fractional seconds and/or leap seconds, shall represent an additional day. For this reason, Subscriber Certificates should not be issued for the maximum permissible time by default, in order to account for such adjustments.
Issuing CAs must comply with the CA/Browser Forum Requirements with respect to the maximum validity period, in some cases thereby reducing the effective available Certificate term. In some cases, the maximum validity period may not be realized by the Subscriber in the event the current or future CA/Browser Forum Requirements impose requirements on Certification Authorities relative to Certificate issuance that were not in place at the time the Certificate was originally issued, particularly in the case of a request for reissuance, e.g., additional requirements are included for identification and authentication for certain Certificate type, or maximum Validity Period is decreased.
6 2048-bit keys generated prior to 2003 using RSA may be used for the maximum period allowed in the applicable root stores.

The system development controls for the Issuing CA are as follows:
• Use software that has been designed and developed under a formal, documented development methodology;
• Hardware and software procured are purchased in a fashion to reduce the likelihood that any particular component was tampered with (e.g., by ensuring the equipment was randomly selected at time of purchase);
• Hardware and software are developed in a controlled environment, and the development processes are defined and documented. This requirement does not apply to commercial off-the-shelf hardware or software;
GlobalSign CP (Certificate Policy) 66 of 78 Version: 7.2

• All hardware must be shipped or delivered via controlled methods that provide a continuous chain of accountability, from the purchase location to the operations location;
• The hardware and software are dedicated to performing CA activities. There are no other applications, hardware devices, network connections, or component software installed which are not part of the CA operation;
• Proper care is taken to prevent malicious software from being loaded onto the equipment. Only applications required to perform the CA operations are installed on the equipment and are obtained from sources authorized by local policy. Issuing CA hardware and software are scanned for malicious code on first use and periodically thereafter; and
• Hardware and software updates are purchased or developed in the same manner as original equipment; and are installed by trusted and trained personnel in a defined manner.
6.6.2 Security Management Controls
The configuration of the Issuing CA system as well as any modifications and upgrades are documented and controlled by the Issuing CA management. There is a mechanism for detecting unauthorized modification to the Issuing CA software or configuration. A formal configuration management methodology is used for installation and on-going maintenance of the Issuing CA system. The Issuing CA software, when first loaded, is checked as being that supplied from the vendor, with no modifications, and is the version intended for use.
6.6.3 Life Cycle Security Controls
Issuing CA monitors the maintenance scheme requirements in order to maintain the level of trust of software and hardware that are evaluated and certified.
6.7 Network Security Controls
Issuing CA PKI components implement appropriate security measures to ensure they are guarded against denial of service and intrusion attacks. Such measures include the use of security guards, firewalls, and filtering routers. Unused network ports and services are turned off. Any boundary control devices used to protect the network on which PKI equipment are hosted deny all but the necessary services to the PKI equipment even if those services are enabled for other devices on the network.
The CA/Browser Forum's Network and Certificate System Security Requirements are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
6.8 Timestamping
All Issuing CA components are regularly synchronized with a time service such as an atomic clock or Network Time Protocol (NTP) service. A dedicated authority, such as a timestamping authority, may be used to provide this trusted time. Time derived from the time service shall be used for establishing the time of:
• Initial validity time of a CA Certificate;
• Revocation of a CA Certificate;
• Posting of CRL updates; and
• Issuance of Subscriber end entity Certificates.
Electronic or manual procedures may be used to maintain system time. Clock adjustments are auditable events.
7.0 Certificate, CRL, and OCSP Profiles
7.1 Certificate Profile
The CA shall meet the technical requirements set forth in Section 2.2, Section 6.1.5, and Section 6.1.6.

9.13 DisputeResolutionProcedures
Before resorting to any dispute resolution mechanism including adjudication or any type of alternative dispute resolution (including without exception mini-trial, arbitration, binding expert’s advice, co-operation monitoring and normal expert’s advice) complaining parties agree to notify GlobalSign of the dispute in an effort to seek dispute resolution.
Upon receipt of a dispute notice, GlobalSign convenes a dispute committee that advises GlobalSign management on how to proceed with the dispute. The dispute committee convenes within twenty (20) business days from receipt of a dispute notice. The dispute committee is composed by a counsel, a data protection officer, a member of GlobalSign operational management and a security officer. The counsel or data protection officer chair the meeting. In its resolutions the dispute committee proposes a settlement to the GlobalSign executive management. The GlobalSign executive management may subsequently communicate the proposed settlement to the complaining party.
If the dispute is not resolved within twenty (20) business days after initial notice pursuant to CP, parties submit the dispute to arbitration, in accordance with art. 1676-1723 of the Belgian Judicial Code.
There will be three arbitrators of whom each party proposes one while both parties of the dispute choose the third arbitrator. The place of the arbitration is Leuven, Belgium and the arbitrators determine all associated costs.
9.14 GoverningLaw
This CP is governed, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Belgium. This choice of law is made to ensure uniform interpretation of this CP, regardless of the place of residence or place of use of GlobalSign Certificates or other products and services. The laws of Belgium also apply to all GlobalSign commercial or contractual relationships in which this CP may apply or quoted implicitly or explicitly in relation to GlobalSign products and services where GlobalSign acts as a provider, supplier, beneficiary receiver or otherwise.
Each party, including GlobalSign partners, Subscribers and Relying Parties, irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the district courts of Leuven, Belgium.
